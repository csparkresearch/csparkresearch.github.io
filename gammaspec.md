### Coincidence Measurements with minimal added cost

The MCA is designed to emit a programmable width digital pulse per event, and also accept digital input pulses
which will then act as secondary discriminators for recording events. Demonstrable coincidence results can be obtained
using just a cable connected from one spectrometer to the other. Conference abstract pending review.


### Environment monitoring

These spectrometers have been tested with natural sources such as gas mantles dipped in thorium, and monazite sand.
