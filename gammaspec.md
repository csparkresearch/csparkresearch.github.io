### Coincidence Measurements with minimal added cost

The MCA is designed to emit a programmable width digital pulse per event, and also accept digital input pulses
which will then act as secondary discriminators for recording events. Demonstrable coincidence results can be obtained
using just a cable connected from one spectrometer to the other.
