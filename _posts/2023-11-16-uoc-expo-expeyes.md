## Gravity by time of flight

In yet another cool demonstration, students delved into the fundamental force of gravity. Leveraging Expeyes17, they measured the time of flight of a falling object, employing this data to calculate the acceleration due to gravity. This experiment involves a metal object connected to a solenoid controlled by ExpEYES. A small contact switch is used to determine when this object hits the ground after being dropped programatically. A precise timer contained within expeyes records the time of flight to sub millisecond accuracy.

## Stroboscopic Effect

The students explored the stroboscopic effect, a fascinating phenomenon where fast-moving objects appear frozen when illuminated by a series of short flashes of light. Through a light source connected to SQ1 square wave generator of Expeyes17, they demonstrated how this effect can be harnessed to visually analyze rapid motion, providing valuable insights into the world of optics and motion perception.
