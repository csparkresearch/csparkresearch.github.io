## Introduction

ExpEYES (an acronym for **Expe**riments for **Y**oung **E**ngineers & **S**cientists) is a science kit 
designed for students to learn science by doing science. 
It has a wide range of experiments from high school level to post-graduation level. 
This short series of posts will help you get started with the ExpEYES-17 box. 

## The terminals

At this point, we shall ignore the technical details of the kit, and 
learn as we go through the various experiments. However, one thing to keep 
in mind is, the terminals on the left (see the image below) are **output terminals**, 
whereas the ones on the right are **input terminals**. 
In both cases, the black terminals are **grounded**, which means that 
all voltages are measured with respect to these terminals’ voltage.

The basic experiments which can be done at school level are:
<ol>
<li> Measuring DC voltage </li> 
<li> Measuring Resistance </li> 
<li> Measuring Capacitance </li>
<li> Resistance by Ohm’s law </li>
<li> Direct and Alternating Currents </li>
<li> AC mains pickup </li>
<li> Separating AC and DC </li>
</ol>

These experiments are basic experiments which would help students to learn 
how to measure various parameters accurately. Once you’re acquainted with 
doing these measurements, you can design your own experiments using the 
features of ExpEYES-17. Some of such experiments which are documented in the 
user manual are:
<ol>
<li> Conducting Human body </li>
<li> Resistance of Human body </li>
<li> Light Dependent Resistor </li>
<li> Lemon Cell </li>
<li> Simple AC generator </li>
<li> Transformer </li>
<li> Resistance of Water </li>
<li> Generating Sound </li>
<li> Digitizing Sound </li>
<li> Stroboscope </li>
</ol>
