## Introduction

The AD9833 must be connected to expeyes via the SPI pins. The control can be accessed from the 'SHOW ALL' button in the oscilloscope.
Connections are as follows
+ SCK -> CLK
+ SDO -> DAT
+ CS1 -> FNC
+ 5V -> VCC
+ GND -> GND

Connect the output to an oscilloscope to view the 0.6V p2p signal.
