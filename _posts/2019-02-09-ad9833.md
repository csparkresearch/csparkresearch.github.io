## Introduction

The AD9833 must be connected to expeyes via the SPI pins. The control can be accessed from the 'SHOW ALL' button in the oscilloscope.
Connections are as follows
+ SCK -> CLK
+ SDO -> DAT
+ CS1 -> FNC
+ 5V -> VCC
+ GND -> GND

Connect the output to an oscilloscope to view the 0.6V p2p signal.

## AD9833 with the Android App
 
It's pretty easy to hook up this DDS with the android app.
Simply create an svg file and
+ add text called AD9833
+ You can add more parameters such as min, max, value, stepsize etc to the description of AD9833 text element to customize it
+ If you wish to enable a single channel oscilloscope for monitoring purposes, add text called A1
+ Set the description of A1 to the following

```
logging=true
mode=scope
xaxis=time
y1=A1
NS=500
TG=3
ymin=-1
ymax=1
```


+ Open this svg file with the ExPEYES17 android app
