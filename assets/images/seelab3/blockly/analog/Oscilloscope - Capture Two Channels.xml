## The capture2 function

This function instructs the hardware to record a set of  voltage values with a predefined time gap (micro seconds) between each reading, from 2 input channels at the same time.

The first input is flexible, and can be configured to read A1, A2, A3, SEN, IN1 , or the MIC input.

The Second input is always attached to read A2.

We then plot the data returned by this function which is of the form `[X[], Y1[], Y2]` where X is a set of time values in mS units, and Y1, Y2 are the set of voltages read for each.

The above 2 steps are repeated 50 times, giving you a functional 2 channel oscilloscope interface
