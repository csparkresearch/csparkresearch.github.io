## Parameters

The voltage on PV1 is swept in equal step sizes along the following path, startVoltage -> Maximum Voltage -> Minimum Voltage -> startVoltage, in order to generate the hysterisis curve.

+ Minimum Voltage : minimum voltage to be set on PV1
+ Maximum Voltage : Maximum voltage to be set on PV1
+ Steps : Total number of datapoints to acquire. 
+ StartVoltage : Starting voltage value for the hysteresis
