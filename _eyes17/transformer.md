- The two coils provided with ExpEYES are used.
- Keep the coils close and parallel.
- One acts as the primary, and is connected to W1, the other is the secondary, and the voltage induced across it is monitored.

- Insert some ferromagnetic marerial through the coils to increase the
voltage induced on the secondary coil.
