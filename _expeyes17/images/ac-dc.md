## Instructions

- Connect the wires  as shown in the figure.

- Set PV1 to 2 volts. 

- Graph of DC will be a horizontal line.

- Now set W1 to 1000Hz. This means the voltage output from W1 will oscillate between 3V and -3V 1000 times every second.

- From the graph, note the times when the voltage crosses 0 Volts in the upward direction.

- Measure the time for one cycle and calculate the frequency from that. Verify that it is close to the set frequency.
 
- You may also use the 'fit' function by using the checkbox next to A2 in the controls section, and this will automatically derive a precise value of the frequency for you.
