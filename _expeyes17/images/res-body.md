## Instructions
___
- Connect the wires and resistors as shown in the figure.Set PV1 to 3 volts.
- Hold the tip of the wires, marked as 'hand', tightly by two hands .
- Current through the 100K resistor I = A2 / 100K.
- Electrical resistance of your body is given by (A1-A2)/I.
- Now,Perform the same experiment using AC from WG instead of the DC from PV1.
