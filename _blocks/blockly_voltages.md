# Introduction

This interface is made up of interlocking graphical widgets with predefined tasks
which can be put together to create a set of instructions to be executed by the phone using
the SEELab hardware.

## Get Voltage

In this demo, you will read a voltage value from A1, and display it on the screen.
For that, the `Read Voltage` block has been dragged from the ExpEYES toolbox, and added to the workspace.
A `Print` block from the `Text` toolbox was also added to the workspace. Then, these two are connected together.
