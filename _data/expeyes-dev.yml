  description: Sent the first design for fabrication. Used a PIC24EP64GP204 micro-controller. Initial goal was to implement a 4-channel scope with at least 1 msps per channel, inputs with programmable voltage range etc. For waveform generation, added an ATTiny processor from Atmel. A 2 channel SPI DAC was used.

  description: Corrected many errors of the first prototype. Added two arbitrary waveform generators, using 2x PIC1572 processors. Communication to these was established via 9-bit UART Cross talk between channels indicated the need for better ground plane designâ€‹.

  description: Replaced quad op-amps with dual, separate op-amps for each channel. Minor bug fixes. PGA reference needs a low output impedance drive.

  description: Hardware and software working as expected but packaging issues remained. Decided to go for 2mm round sockets and Berg strips for Input/Output connectors. Added an inductance meter also. Prototype made with acrylic cabinet. Added Ad9833 waveform generators.

  description: Vlabtool went through many changes, PCB was revised 3 times before the final unit was made. It worked fine and had a local LCD display. Key Features- 12-bit offset control along with up to 32x gain control gave very fine oscilloscope resolution along the full voltage range 2.5ppm digital reference, 5ppm Analog reference 128*64 pixel OLED display that shows readings until a USB connection is detected

  description: Decided to make a very low cost version [no high precision references, PGA etc], attempted gain control using op-amps and uC pins. , but it failed because of reverse voltage protection on uC pins via internal schottky diodes. 28-bit DDS sine wave generator with 0.004Hz resolution up to 2MHz was included. External amplitude control .

  description: Added PGA back, for gain control. WS2812B RGB LED for status display The need was felt for more suitable I/O connectors than the existing banana sockets which require special connecting cables, and are largely cumbersome for quick prototyping in labs. Found some spring loaded speaker terminal connectors, that looked like a good option since any sort of wire could be plugged in

  description: Redesigned the unit with a different form factor, with 2 connector blocks. Added a 5ppm/C clock generator and 50ppm/C analog reference (5ppm optional) for better accuracy. After a couple of rounds of prototyping , one batch was produced, with a new plastic mould. This will be termed SEELablet-V2. Calibration is carried out against a 24-bit ADC, which at this point seems like overkill, so a step down to a 16-bit ADC is expected in the near future.
