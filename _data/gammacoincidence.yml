   imagestyle: medium
   text: Positrons emitted from the decay of 22-Na annihilate and give rise to 511keV which move in opposite directions. When the spectrometers are placed linearly, these can be detected as coincident events, and used to filter out the 1275keV photons emitted by the daughter Ne.
