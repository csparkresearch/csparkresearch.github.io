 title: Results from offline data analysis

 features:
  - The results of the above code on offline analysis of 212-Bismuth spectrum are shown
  - Gaussian fitting was carried out on the first peak(Green) and overlaid.
  - Gaussian+Low energy tail(Lorentzian) was carried out on the second peak (Orange).
 subscript: The Python library is used to encourage students to understand the acquired data, and interpret and analyze it manually instead of relying on the graphical interface. However, the GUI is far more efficient, and feature rich.

topics:
 - title: Calibration
   description: This tutorial explains how to use the region selectors for calculating centroids through gaussian fitting, and using the values to calibrate the instrument.
