   text: Cobalt-60 forms 2 photopeaks due to the gamma rays emitted with energies around 1173 and 1332 keV. This makes it ideal for a 2 point calibration. The calibrated instrument can then be used with other sources such as 137-Caesium, 22-Na, 57-Co etc which are part of the standard enriched source kit available from BRITS

   text: The calibrated instrument can be used to acquire spectra from unknown sources, and the gaussian fitting utility be used for locating centroids of identified photopeaks. In this image, Cs-137 has been identified since its known photopeak energy is 662 keV.
