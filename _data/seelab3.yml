 features:
  - A Python powered tool for learning science by exploring and experimenting.
  - 100+ documented experiments and easy to add more.
  - 4 channel Oscilloscope, 1Msps, +/-16V input range. Programmable voltage ranges
  - Sine/Triangular Wave Generator, 5Hz to 5kHz. Programmable voltage sources, +/5V and +/-3.3V
  - Supports Add-On I2C/SPI sensors for pressure, humidity, temperature, angular velocity, luminosity, magnetic fields, and more.
  - Frequency Counter and time measurements.
  - 12-bit analog resolution. Fully calibrated
 subscript: SEELab 3.0 is the upgrade to ExpEYES17. It features a 40 pin connector, with an integrated breadboard slot for ease of use. External sensors can be connected via a single AUX cable.

 imagestyle: medium
 featurewidth: twelve wide
 imagewidth: four wide
 features:
  - Create circuit diagrams in Inkscape/PS and save as plain SVG
  - Open with the SEELab3 Android app, and watch dynamic content being generated
  - Text such as PV1, WG, A1 are replaced with controls, and meters. Intuitive User Interface.
  - Automatic parameter sweeps, and graphs are also enabled
  - I2C sensors can also be added . e.g `BMP280:1` will render as a pressure guage
  - Derived parameters can also be input as equations !
  - On the right is a schematic diagram for a diode clamping circuit.
 subscript: This feature is under active development, and 30+ electronics schematics have already been added to the app.
